Twitter_Scrapper

This Streamlit app allows users to scrape tweets from Twitter based on two modes: User Tweet Search (fetch tweets from a specific user) and Keyword Tweet Search (fetch tweets containing a specific keyword within a date range). Users can input parameters such as the username, keyword, date range, and the number of tweets to scrape. The results are displayed in a DataFrame, and users can download the data as a CSV file. Built with snscrape, pandas, and streamlit, this tool makes it easy to gather Twitter data for analysis or research.
